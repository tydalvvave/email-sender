##### EmailSender
EmailSender is a Java program that runs from a console window; however, it can be run using an IDE. The program does not require any input. It simply sends me an e-mail with a pre-determined message using a Java socket connection. This connection is based upon a local mail server, using one of the mail exchanger addresses as a parameter. There is also a version of the program with an implemented GUI that can be run by an IDE.

##### Find your local mail server:
1. Open a terminal/console window
2. Enter the following command **nslookup -type=mx (yourWebsiteName)**
3. Replace **(yourWebsiteName)** with the name of a website with an internal mail server
4. Find one of the mail exchanger addresses to use for the program
